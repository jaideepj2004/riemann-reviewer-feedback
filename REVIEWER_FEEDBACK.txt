                    REVIEWER FEEDBACK — READ BEFORE MAKING SUBMISSION FILES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY: ALL REVIEWER FEEDBACK (read this first)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ANSWER FORMAT
   - Final answer must be a three-digit integer when required (e.g. 009 not 9).

2. PROOF / JUSTIFICATION
   - Solutions must be fully self-contained. No "carrying out the recursion
     gives..." or "checking all subsets yields...". Provide a full proof
     (recurrence + table, or explicit bound) so the answer is verifiable
     without software or programmatic verification.

3. EXACTNESS IN ARGUMENTS
   - If you conclude "exactly N" (e.g. exactly 6 real roots), you must give
     both a lower and an upper bound. "Multiple of 3" alone does not imply
     "exactly 6" (could be 9, 12, ...). Add an exact root-count step where
     needed.

4. ORIGINALITY — PROBLEM NOT ORIGINAL (critical)
   - Submissions must be original. Swapping only values or parameters does
     NOT make a new task.
   - Do NOT submit more problems with this structure: polynomial + parameter
     range + "how many parameters give X real roots (or specific root
     property)". Six such similar submissions were flagged (see list below).
   - Do NOT submit problems that are direct specializations of well-known
     sequences or drill-site material (e.g. Pell-Lucas (1+sqrt(2))^n +
     (1-sqrt(2))^n, OEIS, Brainly, Tiger Algebra). "Mod 1000" does not make
     them original.
   - Use genuinely different problem types: identities, sums, geometry,
     different combinatorics, etc., and ensure non-trivial original reasoning.

5. TOO EASY (Automated LLM evaluation)
   - If reviewer feedback says "Difficulty: Too Easy. 0/5 models stumped",
     do not resubmit the same question; move it to the TOO EASY list below and
     use harder problems for the target difficulty.

6. SOLUTION FORMAT — STEPS, EXPLANATION, AND TONE
   - The solution must break content into clear steps; do not leave claims
     unexplained or unproven.
   - Every non-obvious claim must be explained or proven in the solution.
   - Avoid solutions that read as generic or "AI signature detached" (formulaic,
     unexplained jumps, lack of step-by-step structure). Write in a clear,
     stepwise, human style with full justification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOO EASY — Submissions (0/5 models stumped; do not resubmit as-is)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission: tr(P(M)) mod 1000 — matrix M, polynomial P(x)=x^8-2x^5+x^3+3x-7
(SUBMISSION_QUESTION_1_tr_P_M_mod1000.txt or equivalent)
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Reviewer feedback:
- General Difficulty: [Automated LLM Evaluation] Difficulty: Too Easy. 0/5 models stumped.

Problem (for reference):
Let M = [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]], P(x) = x^8 - 2x^5 + x^3 + 3x - 7.
Characteristic polynomial χ(λ) = λ^3 - 3λ^2 + 3λ - 2; Cayley–Hamilton χ(M)=0.
Compute tr(P(M)) (mod 1000). Answer: 183.

Note: Most models solve via eigenvalues (tr(P(M))=P(λ_1)+P(λ_2)+P(λ_3)), χ=(λ-2)(λ^2-λ+1), λ^3=-1 for the quadratic roots, and Vieta. Use a harder variant or a different problem type for target difficulty.

Submission: Quartic with parameters (a,b), four distinct integer roots
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Reviewer feedback (verbatim):
- "This problem is far below high school level and not acceptable into the project."

Problem (for reference):
Find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers with $a, b \leq 35$ such that $x^4 - (2a + 2b)x^2 + (a - b)^2 = 0$ has four distinct integer roots.

Action: Do not submit problems at or below high school level; ensure difficulty is appropriate for the project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETAILED FEEDBACK (by submission / topic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission: f(x)=x^3-3x+1, f°3(x)=x count (SUBMISSION_f_cubic_f_circ_3_x_equals_x_count.txt)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2, reviewer feedback before resubmit.

Feedback received:
1. The final answer should be a three-digit integer (009 instead of 9).
2. In step 2, you establish lower bounds (at least some extra roots), but then
   conclude there are exactly 6 real roots of Q from divisibility-by-3
   considerations. That conclusion does not follow: a multiple of 3 up to
   degree 24 could be 6, 9, 12, …, 24. So exactness is missing.
3. Fix: to make the solution complete, you need one exact root-count step for
   Q(x) = (f°3(x)-x)/(f(x)-x).

Fixes applied:
- Answer field and Step 3 now use 009 (three-digit form).
- Step 2 updated with an explicit upper bound: in each interval (r_1,r_2),
  (r_2,r_3), (r_3,2], use critical points of f°3 to show h has at most three
  monotonic segments per interval, hence Q has at most 2 roots per interval;
  so Q has at most 6 real roots. With lower bound 6, Q has exactly 6.

Second round of reviewer feedback (Step 2 still not fully rigorous):
Verbatim: "Step 2 is still not fully rigorous. You claim 'The real roots of $Q$
are exactly the period-3 points (minimal period 3), and they come in 3-cycles,
so the number of real roots of $Q$ is $0$, $3$, or $6$.' but this isn't fully
justified. The only obvious restriction is that the total number of real roots
of $Q$ can't exceed its degree 24, so we could technically have up to 8 real
3-cycles. You need to provide more justification to why these cases are
eliminated."

Fix applied: Step 2 was rewritten to (1) state that the number of real roots
of Q is a multiple of 3 and could a priori be 0, 3, 6, …, 24; (2) prove a
lower bound of 6 (IVT in each interval); (3) prove an upper bound of 6 by
showing that between any two consecutive points in [r_1,2] where (f°3)'(x)=0,
h(x)=f°3(x)-x is strictly monotonic, so at most one root of h per subinterval;
then counting exactly 8 such critical points in (r_1,2) (5 from x or f(x) in
{-1,1}, plus 3 from f(x)=0), hence at most 9 roots of h, hence at most 6
roots of Q. So Q has exactly 6 real roots.

Not sufficiently unique — Count polynomials with coeffs in box / pairs + divisibility (e.g. a^n + b^n)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received (verbatim):
"This prompt is not sufficiently unique. This is too similar to previous prompts that you've submitted relating to pairs of positive integers and checking divisibility with $a^n + b^n$ and similar terms. Please try to write more unique prompts in the future."

Example (do not submit more of this type):
Consider all monic cubic polynomials $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ with integer coefficients $a,b,c$ each in $\{-5,\dots,5\}$. How many such polynomials have all three roots integers, and each root lies in the interval $[-3,3]$?

Pattern: Reviewer groups this with "pairs of positive integers + divisibility (e.g. $a^n + b^n$)" and similar parameter-box counting tasks. Avoid: (1) count pairs/triples of integers in a range with divisibility or equation conditions, (2) count polynomials (or other objects) whose coefficients/parameters lie in a box and satisfy root/count conditions. Use genuinely different problem types.

Action: Do not submit further "count objects in a parameter box" or "pairs (a,b) + divisibility / $a^n+b^n$" style problems. Vary problem types significantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution quality: claims not explained/proven; no steps; AI signature detached
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received (verbatim):
- The solution makes claims that are not properly explained or proven.
- The content is not broken down into steps.
- AI signature detached through the solution.

Action: For every submission, (1) break the solution into clear steps, (2) explain
or prove every non-obvious claim, (3) avoid generic or formulaic prose so the
solution does not read as detached AI output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not original: tan(x) = x (number of solutions) — widely discussed online
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The problem is a straightforward specialization of the widely discussed problem
  tan(x) = x (usually posed generally or on standard intervals), so it appears
  online under that broader form.
- The author's solution (IVT plus monotonicity via f'(x) = sec^2 x − 1 = tan^2 x
  and one root per (kπ, kπ+π/2)) also mirrors standard online arguments.

References (do not submit problems that are specializations of these):

Action: Avoid submitting "how many solutions does tan(x) = x have [on interval X]?"
or any specialization of this classic problem; solution method is standard and
widely reproduced online.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verbatim reviewer feedback — Originality / substantially similar (save as-is):
According to the guidelines, submissions must be original. Please do not submit
substantially similar tasks; just swapping values or parameters does not make a
new or different task.
You submitted several similar submissions with the same structure (defining a
polynomial, define some variables in the equation, define a range for variables,
ask how many variables make the polynomial to have a specific number of real
roots (or no real root), and ...)
Your similar submission is as follows:

1-The polynomial $x^6 - 5x^5 + 5x^4 + 5x^2 - 5x + 1 = kx^3$ has exactly 4 distinct real roots. Find the number of integers $k$ with $|k| \leq 50$ for which this holds.

2-Find the number of ordered pairs $(p, q)$ of integers with $|p| \leq 12$, $|q| \leq 12$ such that the polynomial $x^4 + px^2 + q$ is the product of two irreducible quadratics over $\mathbb{Q}$.

3-Find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of integers with $|a|, |b| \leq 10$ such that $x^4 + (a - b)x^3 + abx^2 + (b - a)x + 1 = 0$ has exactly two real roots.

(For a longer list of the same type, see "General guideline: Originality" below.)

Submission: No 3-term AP subsets of {1,...,15} (SUBMISSION_QUESTION_97_no_3term_AP_subsets_1_15_mod1000.txt)
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The answer is not justified: "Carrying out this recursion over the 15 positions
  (equivalently, checking each of the 2^15=32768 subsets against the 49 forbidden
  triples) gives an exact total of". The solution is not allowed to rely on
  external software or programmatic verification; it must be fully self-contained.
  Provide a full proof.

Verbatim reviewer feedback (save as-is):
"The answer is not justified: \"Carrying out this recursion over the 15 positions
(equivalently, checking each of the $2^{15}=32768$ subsets against the 49 forbidden
triples) gives an exact total of\". Bare in mind the solution is not allowed to
rely on external software (or programmatic verification) of any sort, it needs to
be fully self-contained, so please provide a full proof.\"

Fixes applied:
- Replaced Step 2 with a complete recursion: F(n) = number of AP-free subsets
  of {1,...,n}, with F(0)=1 and F(n)=F(n-1)+G(n), where G(n) counts AP-free
  subsets of [n-1] that can be extended by n (no pair (a,b) with (a,b,n) an AP).
  Forbidden pairs when adding n: (2b-n, b) for b = ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.
  Full table F(1) through F(15) is given so the count 2692 is verifiable by
  hand (no program or "carrying out" handwave).

Submission: Sum v_5(k!)·v_2(k!) mod 1000 (SUBMISSION_QUESTION_18_v5_v2_factorial_sum_mod1000.txt)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The topic used ("Number theory / elementary combinatorics (factorial valuations)")
  is not currently open for submission. Reframe the problem so that it falls into
  one of the currently open topics (e.g. Algebra, Linear Algebra, Calculus And
  Differential Equations).
- The answer (638) is correct and the reasoning is correct, but the solution is
  probably too brute force to be accepted.

Verbatim reviewer feedback (save as-is):
"Thank you for your work.
As you say yourself, 'The problem uses Legendre's formula for $v_p(n!)$, grouping
by ranges where $v_5(k!)$ is constant, and summing products. Number theory /
elementary combinatorics (factorial valuations)'. Neither of these topics is
currently open for submission. Please reframe the problem so that it falls into
one of the currently open topics. The answer is correct, and so is the reasoning,
although it's probably too brute force to be accepted."

Question (for reference):
For a prime $p$ and positive integer $n$, let $v_p(n!)$ denote the $p$-adic
valuation of $n!$ (the largest power of $p$ dividing $n!$). Compute
$$\sum_{k=1}^{100} v_5(k!) \cdot v_2(k!) \bmod 1000.$$
Answer: 638.

Fixes to consider if resubmitting:
- Classify under an open topic (e.g. Algebra) and justify in the Topic Explanation
  (e.g. "finite sums and modular arithmetic; Legendre formula as algebraic
  identity").
- Or replace with a problem that naturally fits Algebra / Linear Algebra /
  Calculus And Differential Equations without relying on number theory or
  combinatorics as the primary topic.

Originality — Subgroups and special elements of GL(n, F_p) / SL(n, F_p)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The submission is not sufficiently original. Please significantly revise to
  comply with guidelines. It follows a pattern similar to previous questions.

Pattern: 3.3 Subgroups and Special Elements of $GL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ and $SL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$

Identifying features:
- The problem refers to a well-known matrix group $GL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ or $SL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ by name.
- The question counts subgroups of a given order, elements with a specific trace, elements that are "quadratic residues" in the group (i.e. $A = X^2$ for some $X \in G$), or similar group-structural properties.
- Uses group-theoretic language: order, conjugacy class, centralizer, quadratic residue.

Example (do not submit more of this type):
How many $2 \times 2$ matrices with entries in $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ have multiplicative order exactly $4$ in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})$?

Verbatim reviewer feedback (save as-is):
"Thank you for your submission. The submission is not sufficiently original. Please significantly revise the submission to comply with our guidelines. It follows a pattern similar to the previous question, as shown below: 3.3 Subgroups and Special Elements of $GL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ and $SL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ — Identifying features: The problem refers to a well-known matrix group $GL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ or $SL(n, \mathbb{F}_p)$ by name; the question counts subgroups of a given order, elements with a specific trace, elements that are 'quadratic residues' in the group (i.e. $A = X^2$ for some $X \in G$), or similar group-structural properties; uses group-theoretic language: order, conjugacy class, centralizer, quadratic residue.

Action: Do not submit further problems that count elements/subgroups in GL_n(F_p) or SL_n(F_p) by order, trace, quadratic residue, or similar. Use genuinely different problem types (e.g. identities, sums, geometry, other combinatorics, non-group-structural linear algebra).

Not sufficiently unique — Symmetric expressions in roots of a cubic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- This problem is not sufficiently unique. Do not submit further problems of this type.
- Uniqueness: The submission is not sufficiently original. Please modify the submission significantly to adhere to our guidelines.
- Too many tasks with the same recipe: "Some computations involving the roots of a polynomial of some small degree." Do not re-use the same idea over and over.

Verbatim rejection: "Uniqueness: The submission is not sufficiently original. Please modify the submission significantly to adhere to our guidelines."
Verbatim (recipe): "This cannot be accepted because there are too many tasks with this recipe (Some computations involving the roots of a polynomial of some small degree). Please make sure all your submissions are fully original and don't re-use the same idea over and over again."

Pattern: Given a monic cubic with real roots $r > s > t$, ask to compute a symmetric (or cyclic) polynomial in the roots, e.g. $r^2 s + s^2 t + t^2 r$, $rs + st + tr$, or similar expressions reducible by Vieta and the relation $r^3 = ar + b$ (etc.). Swapping coefficients or the exact expression (e.g. $(r^2+s)(s^2+t)(t^2+r)$) does not make a new task. Same recipe: computations involving roots of a polynomial of small degree.

Examples (do not submit more of this type):
1. Let $r > s > t$ be the three real roots of $x^3 - 19x + 19 = 0$. Compute $r^2 s + s^2 t + t^2 r$.
2. Let $r > s > t$ be the three real roots of $x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x - 1 = 0$. Compute $r^2 s + s^2 t + t^2 r$.
3. Let $r$, $s$, $t$ be the three real roots of $x^3 - 13x + 13 = 0$. Compute $(r^2 + r + 1)(s^2 + s + 1)(t^2 + t + 1)$.
4. Let $r > s > t$ be the three real roots of $x^3 - 13x + 13 = 0$. Compute $r^2 s + s^2 t + t^2 r$.
5. Let $r > s > t$ be the three real roots of $x^3 - 9x + 9 = 0$. Compute $(r^2 + s)(s^2 + t)(t^2 + r) \bmod 1000$.

Action: Avoid problems of the form "roots $r,s,t$ of $x^3 + ax + b = 0$ (or similar), compute [symmetric/cyclic polynomial in $r,s,t$]" or any computation involving roots of a polynomial of small degree. Use genuinely different problem types (e.g. combinatorics, number theory, geometry, different algebra).

General guideline: Originality — avoid substantially similar tasks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2 (submission guidelines).

Feedback received:
- Submissions must be original. Do not submit substantially similar tasks; just
  swapping values or parameters does not make a new or different task.
- Several similar submissions were identified with the same structure: define a
  polynomial, define variables in the equation, define a range for variables,
  ask how many (or count) parameter values yield a specific number of real roots
  (or no real root), etc.

Your similar submissions (same structure — do not submit more of this type):
1. Find the number of integers $a$ with $|a| \leq 30$ such that
   $x^4 + ax^3 + (a+2)x^2 + (a+2)x + 1 = 0$ has a root $r$ satisfying
   $|r| = 1$ and $r \neq \pm 1$.
2. The polynomial $x^6 - 5x^5 + 5x^4 + 5x^2 - 5x + 1 = kx^3$ has exactly 4
   distinct real roots. Find the number of integers $k$ with $|k| \leq 50$
   for which this holds.
3. Find the number of ordered pairs $(p, q)$ of integers with $|p| \leq 12$,
   $|q| \leq 12$ such that the polynomial $x^4 + px^2 + q$ is the product of
   two irreducible quadratics over $\mathbb{Q}$.
4. Find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of integers with $|a|, |b| \leq 10$
   such that $x^4 + (a - b)x^3 + abx^2 + (b - a)x + 1 = 0$ has exactly two
   real roots.
5. Find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers with
   $a, b \leq 20$ such that $P(x) = x^3 - (a+b)x^2 + abx - a^2$ has exactly
   one real root and that root is irrational.
6. The polynomial $x^5 + ax^3 + bx$ has exactly 3 distinct real roots. Find
   the number of pairs $(a, b)$ of integers with $|a|, |b| \leq 12$ for which
   this holds.
7. Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $|a| \le 10$ and $|b| \le 10$. How many
   ordered pairs $(a,b)$ are there for which all four roots of the polynomial
   $x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + a x + 1$ are real?
8. The polynomial $P(x) = x^6 - 9x^4 + 24x^2 + k$ has exactly 2 distinct real
   roots. For how many integers $k$ with $|k| \leq 80$ does this occur?

Action: When creating new submissions, avoid this pattern (polynomial + parameter
range + “how many parameters give X real roots / specific root property”).
Choose genuinely different problem types (e.g. identities, sums, geometry,
different combinatorics, etc.).

Feedback received:
- This problem is not sufficiently unique. Same pattern as polynomial +

  above). Do not submit further problems of this type.

Example (do not submit more of this type):
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $|a| \le 10$ and $|b| \le 10$. How many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ are there for which all four roots of the polynomial
$$x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + a x + 1$$

Feedback received:
- Uniqueness: The submission is not sufficiently original. Please modify the submission to adhere to our guidelines.

Example (do not submit more of this type):
Find the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ of distinct positive integers with $a, b, c \leq 20$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc) - ca$.

Action: Avoid problems of the form "find the number of ordered pairs/triples of integers in a box satisfying [algebraic equation]"; same meta-structure as other rejected counting-in-box problems. Use genuinely different problem types.

Not sufficiently unique — Coefficient in power of (1 + x + x^2)^n mod 1000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- This problem is not sufficiently unique. Do not submit further problems of this type.

Pattern: Expand $(1 + x + x^2)^n$ (or similar trinomial power) and ask for a specific coefficient modulo 1000. Swapping exponent (e.g. 30) or power (e.g. 29) does not make a new task.

Example (do not submit more of this type):
Let $P(x) = (1 + x + x^2)^{30}$. Find the coefficient of $x^{29}$ in $P(x)$, modulo 1000.

Action: Avoid problems of the form "coefficient of $x^k$ in $(1+x+x^2)^n$ (or similar) mod 1000". Use genuinely different problem types.

Not sufficiently unique — Discriminant of polynomial mod 1000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- This problem is not sufficiently unique. Do not submit further problems of this type.

Pattern: Given a polynomial (quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc.), compute its discriminant modulo 1000. Swapping coefficients or degree does not make a new task.

Example (do not submit more of this type):
Find the discriminant of $x^4 - 3x^2 + x + 1$ modulo $1000$.

Action: Avoid problems of the form "discriminant of [polynomial] mod 1000". Use genuinely different problem types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plagiarism / non-original: Pell-Lucas type problem (y - 1/y = 2, mod 1000)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- From y - 1/y = 2 we get y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0, hence y = 1 +/- sqrt(2); for odd n,
  y^n - y^{-n} = (1+sqrt(2))^n + (1-sqrt(2))^n = Q_n (Pell-Lucas). The equation
  y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0 and this setup appear on tiger-algebra.com. The specific
  n=7 value (1+sqrt(2))^7 + (1-sqrt(2))^7 = 478 is explicitly posted online
  and listed as Q_7 in OEIS; the problem is a direct specialization of that
  material. The "mod 1000" is incidental. (References: brainly.in question
  21067641, OEIS Pell-Lucas sequence.)
- The candidate is therefore considered too close to existing online content;
  avoid submitting problems that are direct specializations of well-known
  sequences (Pell-Lucas, etc.) or step-by-step copies of drill sites.

Action: Do not submit problems of the form "compute (1+sqrt(2))^n + (1-sqrt(2))^n
mod 1000" or variants that reduce to Pell-Lucas / recurrence values that are
trivially searchable (OEIS, Brainly, Tiger Algebra, etc.). Ensure problems
require non-trivial, original reasoning rather than lookup.

Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The problem seems to be adapted from https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2025s.pdf, so this task is not original.

Problem (do not submit — source: Putnam archive):
Define $b_0 = 0$ and for $n \geq 0$ define $b_{n+1} = 2b_n^2 + b_n + 1$. For $k \geq 1$, let $V(k)$ be the exponent of $2$ (the $2$-adic valuation) in the integer $b_{2^{k+1}} - 2b_{2^k}$; that is, $V(k) = v_2\big(b_{2^{k+1}} - 2b_{2^k}\big)$ where $v_2(m)$ is the largest nonnegative integer $\alpha$ such that $2^\alpha \mid m$. Compute $V(3)$. Return the integer $V(3)$.

Action: Do not submit problems adapted from contest archives (Putnam, IMO, etc.) or other published sources. Ensure submissions are original and not traceable to a known contest or webpage.

Not accepted: Too many similar prompts (pairs/triples/n-tuples + condition)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The submission is not accepted because there are already many (20+) similar
  prompts using the same recipe: "Find the number of pairs/triples/4-tuples of
  small integers (finite combinations) such that divisibility condition /
  Diophantine equation / a polynomial of degree <= 4 follows certain pattern."
- Please stop making prompts like these: having too many similar prompts
  reduces the quality (diversity) of the dataset.

Verbatim reviewer feedback (save as-is):
"The submission is not accepted because there are already many (20+) similar prompts using the same recipe: \"Find the number of pairs/triples/4-tuples of small integers (finite combinations) such that divisibility condition / Diophantine equation / a polynomial of degree \\le 4 follows certain pattern.\" Please stop making prompts like these: having too many similar prompts reduce the quality (diversity) of the dataset."

Action: Do not submit prompts of the form: count pairs/triples/4-tuples of
small integers (finite range) such that a divisibility condition, Diophantine
equation, or polynomial of degree <= 4 satisfies some pattern. Choose
different problem types to preserve dataset diversity.

Originality failure: Beatty sequence / floor(n*sqrt(2)) alternating parity sums
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- The submission fails the originality requirement. The problem using floor of
  n times sqrt(2) with alternating parity sums is a standard Beatty sequence
  exercise found in contest archives and textbooks. This lacks the novelty
  required for Riemann submission. The originality failure alone mandates
  rejection per guidelines.
- Additionally: answer format must be 000 not 0; topic should be Number Theory
  not Algebra; grade level should be High School not Undergraduate.

Action: Do not submit problems that are standard Beatty sequence exercises
(floor(n*alpha), alternating sums, parity, etc.) from contest archives or
textbooks. They lack novelty. Also use three-digit answer (000 not 0), correct
topic (Number Theory vs Algebra), and correct grade level (High School vs
Undergraduate) where specified by the form.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsupported answer: do not cite a script; use mathematical classification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2 (e.g. palindromic / root-count submission).

Feedback received:
- The final count is good and the provided list are correct, but the solution
  said something like: "Accept the triple iff every root has zero imaginary
  part (within numerical tolerance) and real part in [-2, 2]. This is
  implemented in a short script (e.g. enum_palindromic.py in the project)".
  Obviously such a script is not provided and is not reproducible; although
  the list is complete, you do not show how it was constructed. Therefore the
  final answer is unsupported and the submission does not meet project quality
  standards.
- Fix: Use a mathematical classification instead of that sentence mentioning a
  script, and resubmit.

Action: Never justify a count or list by referring to a script or program that
is not in the submission. Show how the list/count was constructed using
mathematical reasoning (classification, recurrence, explicit criteria) so the
answer is reproducible and meets project quality standards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not accepted: Heavy calculations + unjustified table + ambiguous prompt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- This type of submission is not accepted. According to the guideline,
  submissions that require heavy calculations are not accepted.
- Your solution should justify your final answer. Solutions that require heavy
  calculations or that do not show the calculations and how the final answer is
  obtained are not accepted.
- In step 4 you have "Carrying out this procedure for every n = 1, ..., 200
  yields the following table": (1) you have not shown your calculation to
  justify your answers; (2) calculating all those values is considered heavy
  calculation and is not allowed in this project.
- Furthermore, your prompt is ambiguous: you must mention that a and b are
  integers; otherwise if they are considered real numbers that would be a
  different problem. Please revise your prompt to meet the guideline and
  resubmit.

Action: Do not submit problems whose solution requires heavy calculation (e.g.
computing a full table for n = 1,...,200 without showing the steps). Justify
the final answer by showing the calculations or by a mathematical argument
that makes the count/values reproducible. State all variable types in the
prompt (e.g. "a and b are integers") to avoid ambiguity.

Originality rejection: matrix involutions over Z_16 (verbatim)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received (verbatim):
According to the guidelines, submissions must be original. Please do not submit
substantially similar tasks; just swapping values or parameters does not make a
new or different task. You submitted several similar submissions with the same
structure, and it is not accepted. Your similar submission is as follows:
Let $R = \mathbb{Z}_{16}$ denote the ring of integers modulo 16. Let $M_2(R)$ be
the set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices with entries in $R$. We define the set of
involutions $S$ as:
$$ S = \{ A \in M_2(R) \mid A^2 = I \} $$
where $I$ is the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix. Calculate the cardinality of the
set $S$.

Action: Avoid “count objects in a finite ring/module by brute force / small-case
enumeration” prompts when the structure matches previously submitted recipes.
Prefer different problem types and genuinely new solution ideas.

Not acceptable: black-box reduction chain (det S = 125) / show full derivation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Feedback received:
- Previous review flagged step 4, and it still isn't acceptable.
- “continuing similar reductions … yields $\det S=125$” without giving the
  actual reduction chain is a black box and is not acceptable under the project
  guidelines.
- The solution is not allowed to rely on external software (or programmatic
  verification) of any sort; it needs to be fully self-contained.
- Fix: Either show a full derivation (the full reduction chain) or provide a
  mathematical shortcut that justifies the claim.

Action: Do not skip multi-step reductions with phrases like “continuing
similarly…”. Either show the complete reduction chain, or replace it with a
clear mathematical shortcut/lemma that makes the result checkable without
software.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOT ACCEPTABLE: floor / ceiling functions in the prompt (rounding ban)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date / context: Riemann Phase 2.

Problem submitted:
  Compute $\sum_{k=1}^{100} \lfloor k(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}) \rfloor \bmod 1000$.
  (Answer: 554)

Feedback received:
  "The project guidelines prohibit rounding in any way to obtain an integer
   final answer. This includes floor and ceiling functions, which you use in
   the prompt. Please revise the prompt so that you reach an integer final
   answer naturally."

Action:
  - NEVER use floor $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ or ceiling $\lceil \cdot \rceil$
    functions anywhere in the problem prompt.
  - Do NOT frame a problem as "compute $\sum \lfloor f(k) \rfloor \bmod N$"
    or any other sum/expression whose integer nature relies on flooring.
  - The answer must be a natural integer by the algebraic/analytic structure
    of the problem itself (e.g. a trace, a resultant, a coefficient, a power
    sum, a count) — not obtained by truncation or rounding.
  - Beatty sequences, floor-sum identities (Hermite, reciprocity), lattice-point
    counting via floor are all banned as the primary vehicle for reaching an
    integer answer.
  - If you want to use irrational numbers, the answer must emerge as an integer
    naturally (e.g. norm of an algebraic integer, resultant, symmetric function
    of algebraic conjugates, etc.).
